## **Oracle source code has been implemented.**

- The Oracle and MySQL implementation are **No-Longer identical** ~~identical~~. The Oracle version of this application adds more features than the original MySQL implementation.

## New Features in Oracle Implementation
- More functions within the `myFunctions.php` class (mainly simple stuff.
- Customer table selection
- Order-completion notification for the user

### And crushes the following bugs:

- Users being able to refresh and order more than once.
- OrderID sometimes not being visibile to users.
- Some interactions with Database not working 100% of the time (Oracle is rather... finnicky).
